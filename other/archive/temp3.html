<h2>Act VS Amendment</h2>

<p>An Act is a complete piece of legislation passed by a legislative body like parliament. An amendment is a change made to an existing Act.</p>

<h2>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (The Constitution)</h2>

<p>My Definition<br>
The Australian constitution also known as the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. Made in 1901 the constitution is the rule for making rules. This includes making other acts and the structure of the parliament, court, house of representatives and a lot more. Basically the foundation for a new country called Australia and how it should function and work. The act can also be changed if a majority vote in at least four states agree to do so. This has happened eight times since 1901<br>

<p>Artificial Intelligence<br>
The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act of 1900 wasn't a constitution itself, but a legal act enabling the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia. It did this by formalising the union of six British colonies and attaching the separate, already-written Australian Constitution that outlined the structure and powers of the new federal government. This marked a turning point, granting permission for these former colonies to self-govern under a new national framework.</p>

<h1>Parliament</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>My Definition  <br>
A place of federal level in Australia that makes was and consists of the senate and house of representatives to do everything with laws.</p>

<p>Wikipedia  <br>
The Parliament of Australia is the legislative body of the federal level of government of Australia. It consists of three elements: the monarch, the Senate and the House of Representatives. It combines elements from the UK Parliament and the US Congress.  <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia">Source<0xE2><0x82><0xB5></a></p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence  <br>
The Australian Parliament is the central lawmaking body of the country. It functions much like a heartbeat, with three key chambers working together. The Governor-General, representing the King, provides a symbolic head. The Senate offers equal voice to each state and territory, while the House of Representatives grants power based on population. Together, they create and amend laws, ensure the government serves the people's interests, and determine who leads the nation.</p>

<p>MP → ministerial position, member of parliament </p>

<h2>What is a Parliamentary Government?</h2>

<p>A parliamentary government, also known as a parliamentary democracy, is a system where the legislative and executive branches are intertwined. Here's a breakdown of the key features:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Power rests with the Parliament: The Parliament is the main legislative body, responsible for making and passing laws.  </li>
    <li>Leader from the Majority Party: The party (or coalition of parties) with the most seats in Parliament forms the government, and their leader becomes the Prime Minister or Chancellor.  </li>
    <li>Executive Branch Drawn from Parliament: Government ministers are chosen from members of Parliament, giving the Parliament oversight over the government's actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This fusion of powers contrasts with a presidential system, where the President is both head of state and head of government, and the legislative and executive branches are distinct.  <br>
Here are some additional points to consider:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Head of State vs. Head of Government: Parliamentary systems often have a separate head of state, typically a monarch or figurehead, who represents the nation but holds little real power.  </li>
    <li>Accountability and Confidence: The Prime Minister and their government are accountable to the Parliament and can be removed if they lose the confidence of a majority vote. This keeps the government in check.  </li>
    <li>Opposition Party: The party (or parties) that don't form the government become the Opposition. Their role is to scrutinise the government's actions and propose alternative policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to delve deeper, I can provide some resources on specific parliamentary systems like the Westminster model.</p>

    <h2>Civil VS Criminal</h2>
    
    <p>The line isn't clear but it is there between civil and criminal, the police decides and prosecutors assess and determine if the action falls under a criminal offence or civil dispute.</p>
    
    <p>Criminal Offences:<br>
    If the act is considered a serious offence against the state (e.g., theft,<br>
    assault, fraud), it will likely be treated as a criminal case.</p>
    
    <p>E.g Stealing a phone (punishment for breaking the law)</p>
    
    <p>Civil Disputes:<br>
    If the act involves a disagreement or breach of contract between private parties (e.g., property damage, breach of contract), it will likely be a civil case.</p>
    
    <p>E.g Someone borrows your phone and damages it (you sue to get money to fix it)</p>

<h1>Super</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Super is a way of saving for retirement. Basically if you make over $450 a month then your employer has to pay a portion of it to your selected super fund. You can withdraw this money in retirement. To save this money from inflation they invest in companies with a portion of your money. Then they give a portion of the success and the process repeats eventually making you more money. You can change super funds at any time.</p>
