                    <h3>Civil VS Criminal</h3>
                        
                        <p>The line isn't clear but it is there between civil and criminal, the police decides and prosecutors assess and determine if the action falls under a criminal offence or civil dispute.</p>
                        
                        <p>Criminal Offences:<br>
                        If the act is considered a serious offence against the state (e.g., theft,<br>
                        assault, fraud), it will likely be treated as a criminal case.</p>
                        
                        <p>E.g Stealing a phone (punishment for breaking the law)</p>
                        
                        <p>Civil Disputes:<br>
                        If the act involves a disagreement or breach of contract between private parties (e.g., property damage, breach of contract), it will likely be a civil case.</p>
                        
                        <p>E.g Someone borrows your phone and damages it (you sue to get money to fix it)</p>
